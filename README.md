If Blizzard deletes Weakauras, then what is a Mage to do but create his own little addon that houses at least a few of them?

A small personal AddOn for WoW that simply takes some minor Weakauras and makes them work for Midnight.
- TooltipAnchor
  > Lets you move the anchor point for the in game tooltip.
  
- ChatBackground
  > Creates a simple black frame to be used as a background for the chat frame.
  
- VaultReport
  > Lets you right click the minimap summary button to open/close your vault.
  
- AHFilter
  > Causes the "Current Expansion Only" filter setting in the Auction House & Crafting Orders to be automatically ticked.
  > Puts your cursor focus on the search bar, so you can instantly start typing when you open the Auction House/Crafting Orders


That's it. It doesn't do anything else. If you randomly stumble upon this in the future, dear reader, I won't be maintaining or supporting this for anything other then my personal use.
